            <p>Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. They're
                using our own
                satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Jaguar shark! So
                tell me - does it
                really exist?</p>

            <p>Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether
                or not they
                could, they didn't stop to think if they should. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet
                truck. God help
                us, we're in the hands of engineers.</p>

            <p>My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about
                you little
                bastard! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Forget the fat lady!
                You're obsessed
                with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!</p>
