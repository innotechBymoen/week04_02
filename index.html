        You really think you can fly that thing? So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Forget the fat lady! You're
        obsessed with
        the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Must go
        faster...
        go, go, go, go, go!

        Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what
        is-h-how
        did you get my espresso machine? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could,
        they
        didn't stop to think if they should.

        My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you
        little
        bastard! Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think
        if they
        should. Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right?

        My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you
        little
        bastard! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Did he just throw my cat out of
        the
        window? Just my luck, no ice.

        Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs.
        God
        creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining
        bucket
        seats, and... power windows.

        God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Life
        finds a
        way. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you
        little
        bastard! Checkmate...
